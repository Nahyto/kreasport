Project description
-------------------

The Mapsv3 app was started as a personal initiative to learn how to implement osmdroid in an app with multiple fragments, bottom sheets, custom overlays created from a list of races...

KreaSport aims to rebuild Mapsv3 with a new perspective. The goals for this app are the following:

 - Rebuild the app with the same features
 - Rebuild these features, this time hopefully being able to see the bigger picture and anticipate future expansion problems
 - Use clean code, separate classes properly, use callbacks, intents...
 - Implement a cleaner interface

Finally, once these goals are reached, we may be able to use this app as a clean start, replace Mapsv3 and be able to continue forwards according to the original goal of KreaSport which is to create an app for orienteering races.
